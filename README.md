# Toni's Amazing and All-Powerful Multi-Version Multi-Loader Template Mod

Hello and welcome to the only documentation you're going to get for the 
godforsaken pieces of software used in this template.

This template uses [Essential Gradle Toolkit](https://github.com/EssentialGG/essential-gradle-toolkit), 
and is set up with the following:

- Fabric & Forge in one codebase
- Support for all modern 'LTS' versions, in one codebase (1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.20.1)
- Mixins for both platforms
- Access Wideners / Transformers
- Cloth Config
- Shadow

In addition to all that, I've also set up Manifold preprocessor directives, which I find much 
easier to use than Essential toolkit's built-in preprocessor.

# How to Use this Template

I'm going to assume you're familiar with how Gradle works, and are able to use IntelliJ, otherwise this would be very long.

You're going to need to download the [**Manifold IntelliJ plugin**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10057-manifold), as it is required for highlighting to 
work on the Manifold preprocessor directives. If you're not using IntelliJ, you're using the wrong editor and are on your own.
